## Insight Generated:
Five major financial payment services were analyzed and insight shows clearly that CASH OUT has 9,967,821 fraud attempts with 578 successful fraud outcome, PAYMENT 9,675,077 attempts and zero success rate, CASH IN 6,088,547 attempts and zero fraud outcome, TRANSFER with 2,359,142 fraud attempts and 564 successful fraud outcomes while DEBIT has 185,469 attempts of fraud and zero success rate. 
The percentage of fraud success rate to attempted fraud is below 1% and this can be eradicated total through adequate measures. Total volume of local currencies that passed through the payment system shows clear that CASH OUT and TRANSFER have the highest volume of $68.7bn and $53bn respectively while CASH IN recorded $38.5bn, PAYMENT $3.9bn and DEBIT had less than $1bn.

## Recommendation:
There is a clear indication that PAYMENT, DEBIT and CASH IN are the safest payment systems and effort should be geared towards ensuring that other payment systems like CASH OUT and TRANSFER are adequately secured. Awareness should be intensified on the use of DEBIT payment system because it is one of the safest methods but currently less patronized.
